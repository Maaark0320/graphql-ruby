Although you'll probably need some {% internal_link "custom sources", "/dataloader/custom_sources" %} before long, GraphQL-Ruby ships with a few basic sources to get you started and serve as examples. Follow the links below to see the API docs for each source:

- {{ "GraphQL::Dataloader::ActiveRecord" | api_doc }}
- {{ "GraphQL::Dataloader::ActiveRecordAssociation" | api_doc }}
- {{ "GraphQL::Dataloader::Http" | api_doc }}
- {{ "GraphQL::Dataloader::Redis" | api_doc }}
